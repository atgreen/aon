# aon - pixoo example

This code is from a larger personal project that includes a pixoo
dashboard for displaying a countdown clock to my next meeting in google
calendar (along with coloured 5 and 2 minute warnings), as well as
some financial data I graph from [ledger-cli](https://ledger-cli.org/) content.

<img src="dashboard.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom:1em; width: 50%;">

This code doesn't run by itself.  I'm just sharing it for others to
learn from.
